module.exports = function solveEquation(equation) {
    const parsedEquation = equation.split(' ');
    const op1 = parsedEquation[3];
    const op2 = parsedEquation[7]; 
    const a = parsedEquation[0];
    const b = parsedEquation[4] * (op1 === '-' ? - 1 :1 );
    const c = parsedEquation[8] * (op2 === '-' ? - 1 :1 );
    const D = Math.sqrt(b * b - 4 * a * c);
    const x1 = Math.round((-b + D) / (2 * a));
    const x2 = Math.round((-b - D) / (2 * a));
  
    return [x1, x2].sort(function (a, b) {return a - b};
